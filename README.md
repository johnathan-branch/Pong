# Pong (ðŸš§ Development In Progress ðŸš§)
Classic Pong game implemented in Python!

<b>To run the application:</b> <i>Python run.py</i>

- Right now the user has control of both paddles, for upcoming development I plan on developing a computer opponent to play against.
    - Left paddle controls: 'a' key moves the left paddle up, 's' key moves the left paddle down.
    - Right paddle controls: 'up arrow' key moves the right paddle up, 'down arrow' key moves the right paddle down.
